## **At a glance**

You're reading this because you're new to Twitter and want to learn the basics. Well, you're in the right place.

This guide will provide you with everything you need to know about Twitter as a new user, from creating an account to learning the Twitter lingo.

## **What is Twitter (X)?**

Twitter, now known as 'X,' is a social networking site where users can publish short messages, images, GIFs and videos, and create polls.

Users can also share their thoughts in the form of tweets (short-form messages) or threads (long-form messages) and interact with others.

## **What is it used for/Do I really need it?**

You might be wondering what you could use Twitter for or how it could benefit you. Well, here are some things Twitter can be used for:

- Grow your personal/business brand.
- Grow your audience, gain visibility, network, and connect with people.
- Create awareness about yourself and your skills.
- Keep yourself accountable.

Let me tell you a little backstory: I actually joined Twitter on January 1st, 2023, to keep myself accountable while learning no-code development.

Now I'm using Twitter for all four purposes. Ensure you have a clear and defined purpose before joining Twitter, or you may end up running away or getting lost.

## **Setting up your Twitter(X) Account**

### **Steps to creating an account**

- Enter [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/) on your web browser and click sign up at the bottom of the page. Or download the mobile app and tap 'create account' to set up from there. (You can also select sign up with Google or Apple to log in with those accounts instead.
- On the create account, fill in your name (doesn't have to be your real name), email or phone number and date of birth. Click next.
- Click on sign up. A verification code will be sent to either your mail or phone number depending on what you chose on the setup screen. Enter the verification code and click 'next'.
- Create your password on the next screen.
- After creating, upload a profile photo (optional) or skip it.
- Then you'll be asked to fill in your desired username. You can fill in now or use the generated username.
- For the next screen, you can either allow notifications or skip.
- Next, you'll be asked to select three topics of interest. Select and click 'next'.
- Follow at least one user from the list you will be shown, then click 'next'.
- You'll be taken to your Twitter(X) feed.

### **Add a link**

- Still in the 'edit profile' section, add a link to any external site you would like people to visit, if you have any at the moment. It could be a GitHub link, linktree link, personal site link, or a link to your business site.

### **Make your first post/thread**

- On your Twitter feed or your profile page, click the floating blue plus icon at the bottom right corner, then click on post. (Each post has a 280-character limit, so be mindful of this as you write)
- Perhaps you want to write something longer, then turn the post into a thread by clicking on the small blue plus icon at the right corner.

- You can add images, GIFs and videos to your post(s). It's up to you.
    
### **Send your first DM**

- Click on the message icon on the nav bar at the bottom right corner.
- Search out the name of the person you want to message.
- Then send a DM.

## **Some Twitter terminology you should know**

1. **Quote tweet:** Â A Quote Tweet is a ReTweet that allows you to embed your comments above the original tweet and publish both to your followers. This way, everyone can see the context behind a Tweet.
2. **Retweet:** ReTweet is when you share a tweet without adding any comment or words to the actual tweet. Hence, keeping the original tweet and concept tweeted by the user.
3. **Thread:** A Twitter thread is a series of connected tweets posted by one person, all related to a specific topic or story.
4. **Handle:** The Twitter handle is the unique name people use to find their profile, typically written as "@[your handle]" and found after the "/" at the end of the profile URL
